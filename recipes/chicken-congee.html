        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A hearty rice-based porridge that is easy to make, and will perk you up whenever a cold hits.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 rice cup white rice</li>
            <li>8 C water</li>
            <li>0.5 oz ginger</li>
            <li>12 oz chicken</li>
            <li>2 tsp cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp water</li>
            <li>0.5 tsp chicken bouillon</li>
            <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 pieces green onion</li>
            <li>1 piece cilantro (to taste)</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp chicken bouillon</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the white rice 3 times.</li>
            <li>Boil the water for later.</li>
            <li>While water is boiling, chop the ginger into thin slices, then into thin strips. Chop a few strands of cilantro and green onion into pieces.</li>
            <li>Cut the chicken into thin slices and place it in a bowl to marinate. Add oyster sauce, cornstarch, chicken bouillon (0.5 tsp), and water (2 tbsp). Mix and massage the chicken and marnidae together for 30 seconds until there's no liquid left.</li>
            <li>Add the vegetable oil to the chicken and marinade and mix it around for another 20 to 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Pour the boiled, hot water from earlier into a pot set on high heat & wait for it to boil again. Once it's boiling, add the rice to the pot and stir it around a little. Cover the pot and wait until the water is boiling again (with the rice added this time).</li>
            <li>Once the pot is boiling again, partially cover the pot and let it cook for 25 minutes over medium heat.</li>
            <li>If the rice is soft enough after 25 minutes, whisk the pot rapidly and constantly for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Set the stove to high heat and slowly add the chicken into the pot over the course of 30 to 60 seconds so it doesn't clump. Stir the chicken for another 1 to 2 minutes. Once the pot is boiling again, check that the chicken is cooked through.</li>
            <li>Add the ginger, salt, and chicken bouillon (1 tsp) to the pot. Stir it all together until it's combined.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat & pour out into your serving bowl. Garnish with green onions and cilantro, and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
